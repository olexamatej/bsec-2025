# BSEC 2025

### A Hackathon for BUT Students

**BSEC** is a hackathon designed for students of Brno University of Technology. Within BSEC, we have participated in the **CODE IT! Challenge**, a category focused on coding. This year's assignment was provided by **FNZ**, and the goal was to develop a personal financial management web application with a unique twist—gamification.

## Our Solution

We have built a **web application** that helps users **manage their personal finances** while making the process engaging through gamification.

### 🌟 Features

#### **1. Dashboard**
A central place to view financial status, displaying:
- **Current balance**
- **Monthly income & expenses**
- **Recent transactions**

![Dashboard](README-images/image-1.png)

#### **2. Transactions Management**
Users can:
- View **all past transactions**
- Set up **automatic recurring transactions**

![Transactions](README-images/image-2.png)
![Standing Orders](README-images/image-3.png)

#### **3. Financial Goals – The "Meadow" Concept**
We introduced a **goal-setting feature**, where users define savings objectives (e.g., buying a new PC). Each goal is represented as a **flower** in their personal **meadow (garden)**. The flower **grows** as the goal progresses.

#### **4. Social Sharing & Engagement**
Users can:
- **Share** their financial goals and transactions with others
- **Comment** on shared goals

#### **5. Leaderboard (Work in Progress)**
A leaderboard to compare **goal completion rates** among users. This allows people to **see others’ goals** and engage in friendly competition.

#### **6. Dark Mode Support**
Because no modern app is complete without it! 🌙

## Conclusion
Our web application combines **financial management with gamification**, encouraging users to stay on track with their savings goals in an **interactive and visually engaging** way.

While we didn't get to fully implement the **leaderboard**, the core functionalities—**dashboard, transactions, financial goals, and social sharing**—are all up and running!

🎉 **We had a great time building this, and we hope you like it!**
